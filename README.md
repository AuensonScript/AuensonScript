# Hi there! 👋 I'm AuensonScript

I'm a passionate beginner in front-end development, currently diving deep into HTML and CSS (including Sass). My focus is on building accessible websites that are user-friendly for everyone, regardless of ability. While I’m just getting started, I’m eager to learn and constantly improving my skills.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

Right now, I’m working on improving my HTML and CSS skills, and I’m planning to learn JavaScript, Tailwind, and React soon. I'm also exploring Git and GitHub to manage my projects effectively, though I’m still mastering some of the more advanced features.
